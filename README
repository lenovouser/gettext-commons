INTRODUCTION

 The Gettext Commons project provides Java classes for
 internationalization (i18n) through GNU gettext and Java
 ResourceBundles. This makes it possible to use the original text
 instead of arbitrary property keys, which is less cumbersome and
 makes programs easier to read. Gettext supports the easy extraction
 of user visible strings, marks strings as fuzzy when the original
 text changes to allow translators to check translations, powerful
 plural handling, and build process integration through Maven.

 A tutorial that describes how to use the Gettext Commons is available
 at http://xnap-commons.sourceforge.net/gettext-commons/tutorial.html .
